  <h1>
    StiFluQz Keymap
  </h1>

  <img width="1084" height="788" alt="StiFluQz keymap" src="stifluqz.png" />

  <p>
    StiFluQz, pronounced /ËˆstIflukwIz/ 
    (<a href="https://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/#ipachartstart">IPA</a>),
    is named for the main keys on the 
    alphabetic layers (<code>sti</code>, <code>flu</code>, <code>qz</code>). 
    If a cooler name arises, I may change it.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    This is my personal left-handed keymap for half of a 
    <a href="https://www.boardsource.xyz/store/5f2e7e4a2902de7151494f92">
      Microdox keyboard
    </a>. I use it primarily with my OS layout set to QWERTY US English or 
    QWERTY US International.
    My primary goal is to achieve left-handed typing so that the right 
    hand can remain occupied with a pointing device, especially a mouse pen.
    It is annoying to set a mouse pen down and pick it up again. Specific 
    design goals, mostly related to ergonomics, include:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Compactness</dt> 
    <dd>
      I want to reduce movement of my typing hand. 3x5+3 feels like the 
      largest layout that lets my wrist remain nearly still.
    </dd>

    <dt>Pinky stillness</dt>
    <dd>
      Most of my repetitive-motion strain problems are 
      related to my pinkies. To eliminate horizontal travel, I have assigned 
      only one column to the pinky. I have found that holding modifiers does 
      not hurt as much as character typing; therefore only modifiers 
      are assigned to the pinky.
    </dd>

    <dt>Avoid vertical combos</dt>
    <dd>
      I have learned from experience that vertical combos (ie. pressing
      more than one key in the same column) is uncomfortable for me. 
      Therefore, I avoid it. The main exception to this rule is the pinky 
      column. I find it sufficiently comfortable to hold two or three keys
      simultaneously with my pinky. <code>LCtrl+LAlt</code>, 
      <code>LShft+LCtrl</code>, and <code>LShft+LCtrl+LAlt</code> are all
      acceptable. The one challenge is <code>LShft+LAlt</code>; this does
      require the use of an additional finger. Fortunately, this 
      combination is rare in my experience.
    </dd>

    <dt>Optimizing for letter frequency</dt>
    <dd>
      This goal is not as rigorous for me
      as for many designers, because although I primarily type English prose,
      I do often type in various other human languages and programming 
      languages. Like many designers, I used 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etaoin_shrdlu">"ETAOIN SHRDLU"</a>
      as a starting point, but I raised the priority of some characters that 
      appear more often in the code I write, e.g. <code>x</code> and 
      <code>y</code>.
    </dd>

    <dt>Combos over sequences</dt>
    <dd>
      The majority of characters require at least two
      fingers to type. Many require four. Including modifiers, some may 
      require five or more (e.g. <code>Ctrl+Alt+$</code>).
      Only one keycode is assigned to a one-shot: <code>LGUI</code>. 
      This modifier is common enough that I cannot leave it out, but not 
      so common that I need it to occupy a permanent place on the board.
    </dd>

    <dt>Consistency</dt>
    <dd>
      The use of multiple layers and many combos raises the
      cognitive load above using a larger, single-layer layout.
      To avoid making it even more difficult, I make some keys consistent 
      across multiple or even all layers. The pinky modifiers 
      (<code>LAlt, LCtrl, LShft</code>) are almost entirely consistent across
      all layers. (The one exception is on the Numpad layer, where 
      <code>LCtrl</code> becomes <code>RShft</code> to facilitate text 
      selection when <code>NumLock</code> is on.)
      As a lesser example, <code>Spc</code> and <code>Ret</code> are 
      consistent across the alphabetic layers.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Reasonable Questions</h2>

  <p>
    Even after taking the above into account, there are many reasonable 
    questions that keyboard aficionados might ask about StiFluQz.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Why not an even smaller keyboard like ARTSEY?</dt>
    <dd>
      I had considered ARTSEY and similar keymaps, but due to their
      extreme compactness, they all require vertical combos. Moreover,
      they tend to rely on autoshift and autocomplete, which does not 
      work well when I am typing something other than English prose.
    </dd>

    <dt>Why not ASETNIOP?</dt>
    <dd>
      ASETNIOP shares some problems with ARTSEY, but more basically,
      it requires two hands.
    </dd>

    <dt>Why the Microdox in particular?</dt>
    <dd>
      I started planning by sketching what I thought would be ideal. I then
      looked around the internet to see what others were working on in the 
      area of small ergonomic keyboards. I soon discovered 
      <a href="https://ergogen.xyz">Ergogen</a>, which I used to refine my 
      ideas further. Ergogen also led me to the 
      <a href="https://zealot.hu/absolem/">Absolem</a> keyboard, which I 
      considered trying, but then I found the 
      <a href="https://www.boardsource.xyz/store/5f2e7e4a2902de7151494f92">Microdox</a>
      and decided that I liked its compactness. Not only is the Microdox 
      smaller than the Absolem, it also groups the thumb keys closer, which
      makes it easier to press two at a time. This gives me two more layers.
    </dd>

    <dt>What about the other half of the Microdox?</dt>
    <dd>
      For my purposes, I don't need the right half. However, as you can see 
      in my <code>keymap.c</code> file, I programmed it to mirror the left half.
      This means that with both halves, alternating typing is possible, like 
      with <a href="https://inkeys.wiki/en/keymaps/taipo">Taipo</a>.
      If I wanted to use the right side without mirroring, I would probably 
      turn it into a macropad. (For now, it remains unbuilt.)
